# ArduinoProjects
Projects of my own - simple clock, simple countdown clock, esp8266 and others
Don't need to credit but please, if you need to do such thing for school - do it yourself. Or at least understand the code.

Initially there are 3 projects (2 complete):
  1. Clock - really simple clock, using almost all arudino GPIO, it should be simplified but I had no interest in it. Also using the           internal quartz crystal - the time resolution is not really good, should be fixed,
  2. Countdown - simple countdown from few starting values, built based on the previous clock. Again, time resolution could be fixed,
  3. Wireless temperature and humidity read - using the almighty ESP8266 and DHT22 sensor to have wireless server with data reloaded few       times in an hour. It isn't even close to finish, maybe when I'll find some time I'll update it. What is working are the                  connections - really just code and optimalization (for power consumption) needed.
      Also, if you have anything to replace the voltage divider - do it for your own sake.

All schematics done in Fritzingâ„¢.
